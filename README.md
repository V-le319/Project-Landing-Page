# Project-Landing-Page
 The Odin Project - Foundation Course
This project involves building a landing page based on a design that includes images, color schemes, and fonts. The goal is to create a clean and responsive landing page with 4 main sections and a footer.

Project Overview
Design Images:
Image One: Full Design
Image Two: Color and Fonts
These images serve as references for the structure, color scheme, and font choices for the landing page.

Key Features:
Hero Text: The statement that appears at the top of the web page, capturing the user's attention.
4 Main Sections: Each section of the landing page should be styled to match the design.
Footer: The final section of the page.
